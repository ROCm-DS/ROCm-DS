Data exploration
*******************************************************************

Data exploration is concerned with building a deeper understanding of your data. You try to understand how variables interact with each other, the distribution of the data, and whether there are outliers. To achieve this, you mainly use descriptive statistics, visual techniques, and simple modeling. This step often goes by the abbreviation EDA, for Exploratory Data Analysis.
