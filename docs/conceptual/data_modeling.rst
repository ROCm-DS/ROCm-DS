Data modeling
****************************************************************

Data modeling is the phase you use models, domain knowledge, and insights about the data you found in the previous steps to answer the research question. You select a technique from the fields of statistics, machine learning, operations research, and so on. Building a model is an iterative process that involves selecting the variables for the model, executing the model, and model diagnostics.
