# AMD ROCm-DS

> [!NOTE]
> ROCm-DS is in an *early access* state. Running production workloads is *not* recommended.

ROCm-DS is an open-source software toolkit built on the ROCmâ„¢ platform, enabling high-performance data science and data processing workloads. The acceleration offered through ROCm-DS allows you to process larger datasets and execute more complex workloads in a timely manner. With ROCm-DS, you can access the full power of AMD GPUs, which can significantly improve the performance, productivity, and computational capabilities of data science workloads.

This early access release of ROCm-DS contains the necessary tools to build a complete, accelerated data science workflow on AMD GPUs. Tap into the acceleration offered by AMD GPUs and improve your existing Pandas projects or create a new data processing application from scratch with [hipDF](https://github.com/ROCm-DS/hipDF), a Data Frame library for data loading and manipulation. Build, analyze, and manipulate complex networks using [hipGraph](https://github.com/ROCm-DS/hipGRAPH), a library containing a collection of GPU-accelerated graph processing algorithms.

Overall, ROCm-DS can be used to improve the performance and efficiency of your data science workloads. With its continually expanding support for data science operations and algorithms, ROCm-DS provides a complete solution for optimizing data science workflows and achieving the optimum results possible on AMD GPUs. The ROCm-DS toolkit is under active development and will continue to be expanded, improved upon, and optimized to help you build powerful data processing and analysis applications to achieve your goals.
